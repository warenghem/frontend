care: '<p><strong>Our Dionysos® wine leather is produced using an innovative process
  that transforms the fibers of the grape into an ecological material.</strong></p><p><strong>It
  has been extensively tested so that it has the same characteristics as traditional
  leather:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mechanical: high resistance and total impermeability</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Aesthetics:
  fine and harmonious grain</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Sensory: soft and pleasant
  to the touch, odorless</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Unlike animal leather, it
  does not require maintenance.</strong></p><p>But to preserve the beauty of this
  item over the years, we recommend that you:</p><ul><li><p>Be careful not to scratch
  or rub your item against abrasive surfaces, especially leather finishes.</p></li><li><p>Protect
  your item from excessive moisture and keep it away from direct sources of heat.</p></li><li><p>Gently
  clean the canvas with a soft cloth dampened with slightly soapy water.</p></li></ul><p>For
