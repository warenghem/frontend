care: "<p><strong>Our Dionysos® wine leather has been extensively tested. Produced
  using an innovative process that transforms the fibers of the grape into an ecological
  material with the same mechanical, aesthetic and sensory characteristics as traditional
  leather and - conversely - requiring little maintenance.</strong></p><p>But to preserve
  the beauty of this item over the years, we recommend that you follow these tips:</p><ul><li><p>Be
  careful not to scratch or rub your item against abrasive surfaces, especially leather
  finishes.</p></li><li><p>We recommend that you protect your item from moisture and
  keep it away from direct sources of heat, such as radiators and car interiors in
  summer.</p></li><li><p>Avoid contacting your item with liquids, hand cream and sanitizer,
  makeup, and perfume.</p></li><li><p>To clean your item, gently wipe the canvas with
  a soft cloth dampened with mild soapy water.</p></li><li><p>When not in use, store
  the item in the felt provided with purchase. We recommend that you keep it away
  from high temperatures, excessive humidity or unventilated areas.</p></li></ul><p>If
  you have any questions about your item, please contact us.</p><p><strong>Ecological
  characteristics:</strong></p><p>Around 27 billion liters of wine are produced worldwide
  each year, including a huge amount of material that is not found in a bottle. These
  leftovers from the wine industry can be transformed into raw material with high
  added value.</p><p>Unlike traditional leather, it does not need water or toxic tanning
  processes responsible for polluting soil and water to be produced. Has no impact
  on ecosystems, and obviously does not cause animal suffering.</p>"
